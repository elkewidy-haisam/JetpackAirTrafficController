/**
 * CityMapAnimationController component for the Air Traffic Controller system.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Provides citymapanimationcontroller functionality within the jetpack air traffic control application.
 * Supports operational requirements through specialized methods and state management.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Implement core citymapanimationcontroller operations
 * - Maintain necessary state for citymapanimationcontroller functionality
 * - Integrate with related system components
 * - Support queries and updates as needed
 * 
 * Interactions:
 * - Referenced by controllers and managers
 * - Integrates with data models and services
 * - Coordinates with UI components where applicable
 * 
 * Patterns & Constraints:
 * - Follows system architecture conventions
 * - Thread-safe where concurrent access expected
 * - Minimal external dependencies
