/**
 * Three-dimensional model representation of house for JOGL rendering.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Models house geometry with position, dimensions, and visual properties for
 * hardware-accelerated 3D rendering via JOGL. Supports collision detection, spatial queries,
 * and realistic visualization in the 3D city view.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Store geometric data (position, dimensions) for rendering
 * - Provide visual attributes (color, texture, detail level) for realism
 * - Support collision and proximity queries for spatial operations
 * - Enable type classification and metadata access
 * 
 * Interactions:
 * - Rendered by JOGL3DPanel and JOGLRenderer3D
 * - Referenced by CityModel3D for scene composition
 * - Used in collision detection and spatial analysis
 * 
 * Patterns & Constraints:
 * - Immutable geometry for thread-safe access
 * - Compatible with OpenGL rendering pipelines
 * - Simple collision models for performance
