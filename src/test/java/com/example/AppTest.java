/**
 * Unit tests for App functionality and behavior validation.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Validates correctness of App through automated JUnit test cases. Ensures reliability
 * and prevents regressions by testing core functionality, edge cases, and integration scenarios.
 * 
 * Key Test Areas:
 * - Core App operations and expected outcomes
 * - Edge cases and boundary condition handling
 * - Error scenarios and exception handling
 * - Integration with related components
 * 
 * Patterns & Constraints:
 * - JUnit framework for test execution and assertions
 * - Isolated test methods minimize inter-test dependencies
 * - Setup/teardown methods manage test state lifecycle
